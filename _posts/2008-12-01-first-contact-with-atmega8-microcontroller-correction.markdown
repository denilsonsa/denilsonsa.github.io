At [part 2](http://my.opera.com/CrazyTerabyte/blog/2007/10/26/first-contact-with-atmega8-microcontroller-part-2) of this series of posts, **I've posted the wrong pinout for 6-pin ISP connector**. ...

<!-- more -->Thanks goes to Stig Hornang, who e-mailed me a few days ago. He said he spent two hours until he figured out it was wrong. Sorry about your time, Stig, but thank you very much for pointing it out!

I copied the wrong pinout from [a PDF I found at some personal homepage](http://eds.dyndns.org:81/~ircjunk/avr/programmer/avrprog.pdf) ([local mirror](http://files.myopera.com/CrazyTerabyte/atmega8/avrprog.pdf)). I should have copied it from official documents from [Atmel](http://www.atmel.com/), like the [AVR ISP In-System Programmer](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/Products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2726) [Schematics](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/Avrisp_Sch.pdf) or the [User Guide](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/AVRISP.chm) ([PDF version](http://www.equinox-tech.com/downloads/atmel/avr%20tools/avrisp/AVRISP_User_Guide.pdf)), or even the [AVRISP mkII In-System Programmer](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/Products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3808) [User Guide](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/AVRISPmkII_UG.pdf). What's more, even [this page](http://elm-chan.org/works/avrx/report_e.html) has the correct pinout.

Here is the fixed version:

I've already updated the previous posts with the correct pinout.

Sorry for this mistake, and thank you all for making this series of posts so successful.
