Last night, I came upon _Shirakawasuna2_ at [#gentoo](irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo) channel. He was asking for help with X.org lock-ups with via+nvidia+agp. I told him I had the same problem, and I was using `nv` driver. He told me he could "stabilize" using the `nvidia` driver. Then I asked how, and start writing one more chapter of my nvidia seriesâ€¦


Taking the long story (and conversation) short, he could "stabilize" his system by disabling AGP. To do that, the best way is change `NvAGP` option in xorg.conf file. The possible values are:


    0 - disable AGP
    1 - use NVIDIA's internal AGP support, if possible
    2 - use AGPGART, if possible
    3 - use any AGP support (try AGPGART, then NVIDIA's AGP) [default

([from nVidia driver README](http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8178/README/appendix-d.html))

So, I emerged latest drivers: `nvidia-glx-1.0.8178` and `nvidia-kernel-1.0.8178-r3`. At first, I tried with default `NvAGP = 3`. Looking at `/proc/driver/nvidia/agp/status`, I saw it was using AGPGART. It froze after some minutes, and I could bring the computer up again, without rebooting, by pressing <kbd>Alt+SysRq+K</kbd>, then <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+F1</kbd> and <kbd>Alt+SysRq+K</kbd> again (on my previous crashes, months ago, this could not always bring a working console).

_Shirakawasuna2_ tried value 3 on his system. At first, the NVAGP was used, because `via_agp` module was not loaded on his computer. It froze very fast. Then, he `modprobe`'d that module, and nvidia used AGPGART. X.org froze too, did not take too long. Fortunately for him, he could ssh into the box and kill X.

I did not even try NVAGP, since it will certainly crash. [nVidia README](http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8178/README/appendix-f.html) does not list my chipset as supported for NVAGP.

So, I started X disabling AGP (`NvAGP = 0`). This will degrade the performance a little, but should be a lot faster (and flicker-less!) than with `nv` driver.

Sidenote: On my old slack system, when I had AGP disabled and Riva TNT2 card, high-res videos were played VERY slow. Enabling AGP solved it. However, on my current system I could not reproduce this slowdown.

Well, I'm not really sure if disabling AGP will make this "stable", but I can notice it is far more stable than before! Not sure yet if as stable as `nv` driver. (Now I can play OpenGL games! I haven't played any of those for months!)

Thanks _Shirakawasuna2_ for your suggestion of disabling AGP (well, you did not exactly suggest that, but this was our conclusion).
