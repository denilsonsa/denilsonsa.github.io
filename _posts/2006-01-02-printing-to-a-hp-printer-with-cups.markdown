This is a quick post just to document how I configured my HP 930C printer to print correctly (or almost correctly).


First, I had only CUPS installed, and I was using some generic CUPS-HP-Deskjet "driver". This was ok, until I tried to print some CD labels, and I found it was printed misaligned, and some milimeters smaller.

After hours testing, and lots of paperâ€¦ I found the solution: `USE="cups foomaticdb ppds" emerge hpijs ; /etc/init.d/cups restart`

After the above command, I reconfigured CUPS using web interface, and I found dozens, maybe hundreds, of HP printers in model/driver list. I could also find my exact printer there. So I selected it, and finally could print my CD labels!

P.S: Of course I did not pass the USE-flags at command-line. I added them to `/etc/portage/package.use`.
