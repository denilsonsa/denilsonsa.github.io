# Privacy policy

I don't want your data.

I don't collect your data.

I want to provide good and clean tools.

I might include some statistics-gathering tool (like Google Analytics) to measure how popular my creations are.

I will not add bloatware/adware. I will keep my tools clean.

My creations are open-source, and I am very transparent about their purpose and the required permissions. Feel free to inspect the source-code, I have nothing to hide. Feel free to contact me if you have specific questions.

P.S.: I'm not a lawyer, I didn't get any legal advice for this privacy policy. I'm just being transparent about my intentions.
