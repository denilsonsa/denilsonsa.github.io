# Donation - buy me a coffee

If you arrived at this page, you have found something I have done. Maybe [a project on GitHub][github] or [some post from my blog][blog], or something else entirely. Either way, you like what I have done, and it somehow made your life a little bit better. As a gesture of gratitude, you are considering giving me a tip, buying me a coffee or lunch, or just plain donating a small amount of money. This is the page describes how you can do it.

<!--
I was thinking about adding a GIF or video of "Shut up and take my money!",
but I'm not comfortable uploading it to my site,
and also not comfortable embedding/loading from a random YouTube video (like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdf_19_FmxM).

Not only due to copyright, but also it's a large-ish file (okay, the video in 1080p is just 400KB) stored on the git repository forever.

## How to give me money

These are the official ways you can give me something:

<!-- TODO: Add widgets, buttons, images, banners, whatever is the thing these services provide. -->

* [PayPal][paypal]
* [Ko-Fi][kofi]
* [Buy Me A Coffee][buymeacoffee] (or a pizza)
* [Brave web browser][brave] (through [Brave Rewards](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) program)

[kofi]: {{ site.data.aboutme.kofi.href }}
[buymeacoffee]: {{ site.data.aboutme.buymeacoffee.href }}
[brave]: https://brave.com/

Please, if possible, leave a small message with your donation. That way I would know why I received a little bit of money.

## Conditions

Each donation is final, no refunds. (It's a donation after all!)

Giving me money does NOT mean that I will implement some feature or fix a bug. Giving it is like giving a [tip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratuity). It shows appreciation, it's a more concrete way to say "thank you". It is NOT a contract.

I build and share my projects because it's fun, because I'm contributing back to the community, and because I believe they can be useful to someone in the world. I have a my family and I have a full-time job. Time and energy to dedicate to personal side-projects is scarce. Donations are nice to receive, but they are not enough to pay the bills and feed my family.

<!-- I don't have any plans on setting up a Patreon (I also highly doubt it would be sustainable enough for me). -->

## Thank you!

I won't lie: receiving a donation feels nice. It shows me that something I've done had a very positive impact on someone, so positive that they felt it was worth some money.

However, no one is required to donate. It doesn't matter if you have enough spare money or if you are in a tight budget: you are all equal. Donations are completely voluntary, just like saying "thank you" to someone is also completely voluntary.

If you decide to give me some money, thank you! But even if you don't, I'll be genuinely happy to know that something I built made your life better in some way.

## Sidenote: Troublesome ways to give me money

Gift cards in general are a poor choice for donations. Most of them are restricted to be used only on the same country where they were bought; and they also force the recipient to spend the money on that company. They are fine among close friends who know each other very well; but between strangers on the Internetâ€¦ they are a bad for the giver, bad for the receiver, and only good for the company.

<!-- That said, I wouldn't mind receiving [Bol.com gift cards](https://www.bol.com/nl/digitale-cadeaubon), but it's probably difficult to buy them from outside the Netherlands.-->

<!-- Possibly also by TransferWise {{ site.data.aboutme.transferwise.referral }}, if you type in my e-mail address; but I don't have a direct link to it. -->
<!-- Possibly also by Tikkie https://www.tikkie.me/ but that requires me creating a payment request and sharing the link with someone. It's not meant as a long-term donation link. -->
